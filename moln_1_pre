.TH MOLN 1
.SH NAME
moln \- Convenience shell script to work with cloud services.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B moln {options} [cloud] [command] {arguments}

.SH DESCRIPTION

Moln presents a uniform api that is implemented using cli commands
from different cloud providers. This can be used to do simple work on
multiple cloud providers (all,aws,azure,gcloud) using the same
commands. Moln can also print the underlying cli command to refresh
your memory or when you need to do more advanced commands against the
cloud provider.

Feel free to copy snippets and learn from this code. But as a whole it
is licensed under the MIT license and requires legal notices.
